DFSG repackaging

The file j2kviewer/src/Exec.java does not have a DFSG compatible licence and
therefore has been removed from the Debian source package. As the other files
in j2kviewer/src/ depend on Exec.java, they too have been removed. In addition
upstream no longer supports these files and they have been removed from upstream
SVN and will not appear in any future upstream releases.
