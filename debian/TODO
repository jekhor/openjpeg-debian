TODO for openjpeg:
------------------

  * Reintroduce the files /JavaOpenJPEG/java\ sources/org/openJpeg/* to the
    source package when upstream marks the copyright and licence correctly.

  * Build and distribute some of the additional tools including:
    + mj2/          - motion tools for jpeg2000 files.
    + jpwl/         - JPEG 2000 Wireless tools: encode JPEG2000 files to
                      withstand transmission errors.
    + jp3d/         - Volumetric Imaging.
    + JavaOpenJPEG/ - Java Encoder/Decoder interface for libopenjpeg.
    Note, none of these tools are built by default in the standard OpenJPEG2000
    distribution. They are also not built from the top level makefile. Some of
    the tools do not build cleanly from the source distribution and require
    further work to be able to be included in the openjpeg-tools package.

  * Improve the handling of the .so symlinks, which are at the moment manually
    created through debian/*.links, with hardcoded filenames.
