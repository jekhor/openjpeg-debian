openjpeg (1.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - Drop SVN merge patch as v1.3 contains all required fixes.
    - Update debian/rules to match upstream changes to makefile.
    - Stop ignoring make errors and rm errors in debian/rules.
    - Fix build environment via dpatch to use -O0 or -O3 when requested, use -g 
      to build library and strip via dh_strip and build codecs against shared 
      not static library.
    - Remove linkage against unused libs and add linkage against missing libs 
      (via dpatch).
    - Change debian/copyright to take advantage of proposed format and ensure
      all authors and licences are listed.
